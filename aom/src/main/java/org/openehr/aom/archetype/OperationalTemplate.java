/**
 * Root object of an operational template. An operational template is derived from a
 * TEMPLATE definition and the ARCHETYPEs and/or TEMPLATE_OVERLAYs mentioned by that
 * template by a process of flattening, and potentially removal of unneeded languages
 * and terminologies.
 *
 *  An operational template is used for generating and validating RM-canonical instance data,
 *  and also as a source artefact for generating other downstream technical artefacts, including
 *  XML schemas, APIs and UI form definitions.
 *
 * The OPERATIONAL_TEMPLATE class represents the fully flattened form of a template,
 * i.e. with all fillers and references substituted and overlays processed, to form
 * what is in practical terms, a single custom-made 'operational' artefact, ready for
 * transformation to downstream artefacts. Because an operational template includes
 * one or more other archetype structures inline, it also includes their terminologies,
 * enabling it to be treated as a self-standing artefact.
