/**
 * A specialisation of C_COMPLEX_OBJECT whose node_id attribute is an archetype identifier
 * rather than the normal internal node code (i.e. id-code). Used in two situations. The
 * first is to represent an ‘external reference’ to an archetype from within another archetype
 * or template. This supports re-use. The second use is within a template, where it is used as
 * a slot-filler.
 *
 *  For a new external reference, the node_id is set in the normal way, i.e. with a new code at
 *  the specialisation level of the archetype. For a slot-filler or a redefined external reference,
 *  the node_id is set to a specialised version of the node_id of the node being specialised,
 *  allowing matching to occur during flattening.
 *
 *  In all uses within source archetypes and templates, the children attribute is Void.
 *
 *  In an operational template, the node_id is converted to the archetype_ref, and the structure
 *  contains the result of flattening any template overlay structure and the underlying flat archetype.
